                     <h2>Leo Cappello</h2>
                     <h5><strong>Lead Developer</strong></h5>
                     <p>
                        My name is Leo Cappello. I am a computer science student at Manchester Community College and
                         Central Connecticut State University. I have always been fascinated by computers as long as
                          I can remember and in 2020, I decided to torture myself with this major. I graduated from 
                          RHAM High School in 2020 after four long years of soccer. I have always had a love for video
                           games too. My first gaming console was a Nintendo DSi and then a PSP. It wasn't until I got
                            my first Xbox 360 where my feelings for gaming took flight. I have never been particularly
                             good, but I love practicing things until I can see improvement, just like with school or 
                             any other activity. I have made friends, and enemies, through playing games and strengthened
                              existing friendships all the same. It's something to talk about or show people who also 
                              have this interest. With gaming becoming more accessible and more popular, it would be 
                              hard to throw a rock into a crowd and not hit a person playing a game on their phone 
                              or thinking about grinding away on Minecraft when they get home. It's a nice escape for 
                              people, and for me, it's a hobby, a way to wind down, and even a way to keep in touch 
                              with people over a common interest.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Because of this long love affair with gaming and how long us Gen Z's have had social media; 
                        I see a lot of video games. But it's always the same things repeated for weeks at a time 
                        until something new happens. Social Media accounts reposting all the same stuff nowadays, 
                        I wanted a place that was fresh and only focused on gaming and nothing else. That is why 
                        I created Unpopular Clips. It represents the gaming community as a whole and is a place 
                        you can post your crazy clip and not worry about it getting lost and overshadowed by any 
                        social media trends.

                  <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
                  <p>
                     I have played soccer ever since I could walk. I grew up in a small town, but we always 
                     managed to have a soccer program while I was growing up. I played all the way through 
                     high school with the same team from middle school. We grew as people and as players together
                      and built a decent team while we were at it. I love watching soccer too, hence the interest 
                      in FIFA on Unpopular Clips. Its my most played game over my years of gaming. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     I also love skiing. I try to get out on the slopes as soon as it snows in the end of Fall. 
                     I have managed to get a bunch of my friends into it to, so its nice to have people to go with 
                     and sometimes compete with. In terms of gaming though, there aren't many good skiing games 
                     out there, but it is and adrenaline sport so I can imagine how hard that is to put into a 
                     game form factor. 
                  </p>

                  <h2>Career</h2>
                  <p>
                     I hope to finish my degree at CCSU in Spring of 2024 and graduate with a bachelor's degree in Computer
                      Science. I would like to work in software development, but I also love the idea of working with 
                      artificial intelligence, although I am not the biggest fan of math, it's an interesting career. 
                      No doubt no matter where I end up I will always be learning and always be challenged as the industry
                       is constantly evolving and expanding.
