# UnpopularClips
These days, gamers can hit one crazy clip and everyone will see it all over the internet for weeks until another crazy clip goes viral.
At Unpopular Clips, you will see hundreds of game clips from your favorite games that have never graced the internet before. You will see 
epic plays and epic fails from Fortnite and sick goals and glitches in FIFA. You will find breathtaking quickscopes and kill streaks in 
Call of Duty, and flying portal shots in Splitgate.

We wanted to create a new space just for game clips, without any recycled videos and tired memes. Unpopular Clips is a new, 
fresh website to watch as many game clips as your brain can handle.
